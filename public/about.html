<h1>About</h1>
<hr>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Shikhar Sinha, a first-year Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student at Bangalore 
    Institute of Technology (BIT). I'm on a mission to explore the fascinating world of electronics, communications, 
    and technology.
</p>
<br>

<p>ðŸ”Œ My curiosity for all things ECE led me to join BIT, where I'm gaining a strong foundation in this dynamic field.
     I believe that the intersection of electronics and communication holds the key to solving some of the world's most
      pressing challenges.
</p>
<br>
    
<p>ðŸ’¡ Beyond the classroom, I'm an avid tinkerer and problem solver. I'm passionate about experimenting with circuits,
     coding, and staying updated on the latest industry trends. I'm excited about the potential of ECE to drive 
     innovation and improve lives.
</p>
<br>    
<p>ðŸš€ Looking ahead, I'm eager to connect with fellow students, professionals, and mentors who share my enthusiasm 
    for electronics and communication. Whether it's collaborating on projects, discussing emerging technologies, or 
    exploring internship opportunities, I'm always open to new connections and opportunities.</p>
